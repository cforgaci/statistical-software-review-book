# Standards Files

This directory holds the definitive source files for all general and
category-specific standards. File names may contain only alpha characters and
single dashes -- **not** underscores, because these are used to identify active
categories in the [`srr`
package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/blob/main/R/dl-standards.R).
