Dear [REVIEWER]

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a statistical package for rOpenSci. As you probably know, rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals, including explicitly statistical packages.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (Weâ€™ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a review of a statistical package. Our expectations for authors of statistical packages are detailed in our [authors guide], and we provide a reviewer [template] for you to use. Please make sure you do not have a [conflict of interest](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#coi) preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [rOpenSci forum].

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]
