Dear [REVIEWER]

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a R package for rOpenSci. As you may know, rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.  We have recently expanded our scope from data-management packages include packages implementing statistical algorithms, and this package is one of these.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [SOFTWARE-REVIEW ISSUE]. In that GitHub discussion thread you will find the results of automated package checks, and summaries of package code structure, as well.

If you accept, note that while we generally ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks, this program is still in pilot mode, and review times for statistical software are flexible. We're also eager to hear feedback from reviewers on the general process.

Our guidance for reviewing statistical packages at https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/pkgreview.html. Our standards for statistical packages are detailed at https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/standards.html. Note that packages must comply with both the general standards, and at least one specific category of statistical standards. This package falls under the [CATEGORY] category. The automated checks in the GitHub issue thread include a link to a report of how authors have complied with our standards by annotating their code.  We hope this will aid your review. There's a template for reviewers at the end of the reviewers' guide (https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/pkgreview.html).

Please make sure you do not have a [conflict of interest](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#coi) preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [rOpenSci forum]. If you accept, we also invite you to join the rOpenSci Slack channel.

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]
