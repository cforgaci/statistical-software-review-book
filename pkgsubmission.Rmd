## Editor-in-Chief

Packages will be submitted directly to
[`ropensci/software-review`](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review), as
for the current system, with submissions initially handled by the rotating
Editor-in-Chief (EiC). Statistical software will, however, be handled
differently from the first moment of submission. Statistical submissions will
be identified as such on the submission form, and this will automatically
generate a response from our `ropensci-review-bot` that indicates whether
a submission may proceed (according to the checks listed in the following sub-section).

A positive bot response is sufficient for the EiC to proceed directly to
delegate a handling editor. Additional effort by the EiC will only be required
in "edge cases" where a package may be unable to pass one of the checks. In
these cases, submitting authors must explain why these checks may fail, and the
EiC will have to determine whether these failures are acceptable.

There only additional responsibilities for the EiC prior to delegating handling
editors are to check the following single item:

- [ ] The categories nominated by the submitting authors are appropriate for
  this package

And to choose one the following two items:

- [ ] The package does not fit within any additional categories of statistical
  software.
- [ ] The package could potentially be described by the following additional
  categories of statistical software:
    - \<list categories here\>


### Bot checks executed on initial submission

The checks prompted by an initial submission, and required for the EiC to
immediately proceed to delegate a handling editors, are:

- `srr_stats_pre_submit()` must confirm that all standards have been addressed.
- `R CMD check` must generate no errors, and all warnings must be explained.
- All tests must pass
- Test coverage must be at least 70%
- The package must use [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) to generate
  documentation.
- No function should have cyclomatic complexity of 15 or greater
- The package must contain at least one vignette
- The package must be documented on an associated website



## Handling Editor

The list of steps to be followed by the Handling Editor is derived from the
equivalent steps in the [*Dev
Guide*](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html#upon-submission), 
yet slightly different here both because Statistical Software review
necessitates a couple of additional checks, and because not all of the general
checks are applicable.

**Checks from *Dev Guide* to be applied to Statistical Software:**

- Check against policies for [fit](#aims-and-scope) and [overlap](#overlap).
  Initiate discussion via Slack #software-review channel if needed for edge
  cases that haven't been caught by previous checks by the EiC. If reject, see
  [this section](#outofscoperesponse) about how to respond.
- For packages needing continuous integration on multiple platforms (cf
  [criteria in this section of the CI chapter](#whichci)) make sure the package
  gets tested on multiple platforms (having the package built on several
  operating systems via GitHub Actions for instance).
- Wherever possible when asking for changes, direct authors to automatic tools
  such as [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and
  [`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/), and to online resources (sections of
  this guide, sections of the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/)) to make
  your feedback easier to use. [Example of editor's
  checks](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/207#issuecomment-379909739).
- Ideally, the remarks you make should be tackled before reviewers start reviewing.
- If initial checks show major gaps, request changes before assigning
  reviewers. If the author mentions changes might take time, [apply the holding
  label](#policiesreviewprocess).
- If the package raises a new issue for rOpenSci policy, start a conversation
  in Slack or open a discussion on the [rOpenSci
  forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/) to discuss it with other editors
  ([example of policy
  discussion](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/overlap-policy-for-package-onboarding/368)).

**Additional Checks**

- Appropriately resolve any issues raised during initial processing by EiC.
- Run
  [`autotest_package()`](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/autotest/reference/autotest_package.html)
  on a local version of the source code and ensure no errors are raised.
- Ensure that the submitting authors understand the requirements for their
  package to meet their stated grade of badge (gold, silver, bronze).
