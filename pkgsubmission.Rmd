# Guide for Editors  {#pkgsubmission}

Packages will be submitted directly to
[`ropensci/software-review`](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review), as
for the current system, with submissions initially handled by the rotating
Editor-in-Chief (EiC). Statistical software will, however, be handled
differently from the first moment of submission. Statistical submissions will
be identified as such on the submission form, and this will automatically
generate a response from our `ropensci-review-bot` that indicates whether
a submission may proceed (according to the checks listed in the following sub-section).

A positive bot response is sufficient for the EiC to proceed directly to
delegate a handling editor. Additional effort by the EiC will only be required
in "edge cases" where a package may be unable to pass one of the checks. In
these cases, submitting authors must explain why these checks may fail, and the
EiC will have to determine whether these failures are acceptable.

There only additional responsibilities for the EiC prior to delegating handling
editors are to check the following single item:

- [ ] The categories nominated by the submitting authors are appropriate for
  this package

And to choose one the following two items:

- [ ] The package does not fit within any additional categories of statistical
  software.
- [ ] The package could potentially be described by the following additional
  categories of statistical software:
    - \<list categories here\>



## Bot checks executed on initial submission

The checks prompted by an initial submission, and required for the EiC to
immediately proceed to delegate a handling editors, are:

- `srr_stats_pre_submit()` must confirm that all standards have been addressed.
- `R CMD check` must generate no errors, and all warnings must be explained.
- All tests must pass
- Test coverage must be at least 70%
- The package must use [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) to generate
  documentation.
- No function should have cyclomatic complexity of 15 or greater
- The package must contain at least one vignette
