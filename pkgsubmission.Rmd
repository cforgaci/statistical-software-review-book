## Automated Checks

Upon initial submission, the `ropensci-review-bot` performs a suite of tests
and checks, and will paste a report into the GitHub issue thread. This report
is the primary source of information used to inform initial editorial
decisions. The best way to understand how decisions are to be made in response
to these reports is to provide a concrete example. The remainder of this
initial sub-section contains the contents of such a report, generated for
an R package generated by the [`srr::srr_stats_pkg_skeleton()`
function](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/srr/reference/srr_stats_pkg_skeleton.html),
with additional statistical standards inserted with the
[`srr::srr_stats_roxygen()`
function](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html).

All editors must familiarise themselves with the structure and contents of
these automated reports, an example of which can be seen by [clicking
here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-review-book/blob/main/scripts/pkgcheck-ex.md).
A similar report can be reproduced locally by running the code within the following sub-section.

## Editor-in-Chief

As for rOpenSci's current peer-review system, packages are submitted directly
to the [`ropensci/software-review`
repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) on GitHub, with
submissions handled initially by the rotating Editor-in-Chief (EiC).
Statistical software is nevertheless handled differently to standard
(non-statistical) packages from the first moment of submission. Statistical
submissions use a different template, the submission
of which automatically generates a detailed report from our
`ropensci-review-bot`, as described in the initial sub-section of this chapter,
and [illustrated
here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-review-book/blob/main/scripts/pkgcheck-ex.md).

The EiC need only purvey the summary checks within the initial section of the
report. Most submissions should receive ticks for all items listed, and no
crosses, in which case the initial checklist will conclude with a statement that,

> *This package may be submitted*

In response to that statement, the sole tasks for an EiC prior to delegating
a handling editor are to check the following single item:

- [ ] The categories nominated by the submitting authors are appropriate for
  this package

And to choose one the following two items:

- [ ] The package does not fit within any additional categories of statistical
  software.
- [ ] The package could potentially be described by the following additional
  categories of statistical software:
    - \<list categories here\>


Additional effort by the EiC will only be required in "edge cases" where
a package may be unable to pass one of the checks, as in the [sample automated
check](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-review-book/blob/main/scripts/pkgcheck-ex.md),
which concludes with the statement that,

> *All failing checks above must be addressed prior to proceeding*

In these cases, submitting authors must explain why these checks may fail, and
the EiC must then determine whether these failures are acceptable.
Such cases ought nevertheless be rare, and it may be expected in the majority
of cases that the sole tasks of the EiC are to confirm a positive bot response,
to complete the two checklist items given above, and to allocate a handling
editor. This latter step is done by calling `@ropensci-review-bot assign <name>
as editor`.



## Handling Editor

The Handling Editor can use the summary report generated by the opening of the
issue to guide the steps towards assigning reviewers.

### Automatic Summary Reports {#pkgsub-summary-reports}

The summary report generated when the EiC nominates a Handling Editor includes
the following components:

1. The statistical categories designated by the authors, as identified from the
   [`srr` documentation](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/srr) documentation
   within the package.
2. An overview of [`goodpractice`
   checks](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) checks including:
    - Code coverage estimates for each file (from the [`covr`
      package](https://github.com/r-lib/covr)).
    - Code style reports from the [`lintr`
      package](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr).
    - Cyclomatic complexity reports from the [`cyclocomp`
      package](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/cyclocomp).
    - Any errors, warnings, or notes raised by running `R CMD check` (from the
      [`rcmdcheck` package](https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck).
3. A summary of lines of code and computer languages used (from the [`cloc`
   package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cloc)).
4. An indication of any ways by which the package is statistically anomalous in
   relation to all current CRAN packages. The measures considered include:
    - Size of code base
    - Number of vignettes
    - Number of package URLs given in `DESCRIPTION` file
    - Number of people listed in `DESCRIPTION` file for each ascribed role
      (such as `aut` and `ctb`)
    - Number of exported functions
    - Number of non-exported functions
    - Number of documentation lines per function
    - Number of parameters per function
    - Metrics of white space in code (in terms both of lines and indentation)

Significant issues raised in the
[`goodpractice`](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) reports should be
addressed prior to proceeding with review. The
[`cloc`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cloc)) output can be used to ensure
reviewers have appropriate experience and abilities with the language(s) in
which a package is written, while any anomalies in any of the properties
indicated in the third of these components may need to be addressed prior to
proceeding with review.

### Handling Editor Checklist

The following items comprise the checklist for Handling Editors which should be
pasted into the issue, and all items checked prior to proceeding with review.

- [ ] Any issues raised during initial processing by EiC have been resolved (or
  there were none).
- [ ] The statistical categories seem appropriate, and no additional categories
  would be applicable to the package.
- [ ] **Either** (i) there were no issues raised in the `goodpractice` checks
  which need to be addressed prior to review, or (ii) all issues have been
  appropriately addressed.
- [ ] Running
  [`autotest_package()`](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/autotest/reference/autotest_package.html)
  on a local version of the source code generates no errors.
- [ ] **Either** (i) this package is aiming for a bronze badge, **or**, (ii)
  for packages aiming for silver or gold badges, the authors have clarified
  which of the four aspects listed in the "*Guide for Authors*" section on
  [silver badges](#pkgdev-silver) they intend to fulfil.
- [ ] **Either** (i) the package manifests no statistical anomalies in relation
  to the CRAN archive, **or** (ii) any statistical anomalies have been
  satisfactorily explained.

All of these items must be checked prior to assigning reviewers. This may
require iteration with submitting authors. As stated in the 
[*Dev Guide*](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html#upon-submission):

- If authors believe changes might take time, [apply the holding
  label](#policiesreviewprocess) to the submission.
- If the package raises a new issue for rOpenSci policy, start a conversation
  in Slack or open a discussion on the [rOpenSci
  forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/) to discuss it with other editors
  ([example of policy
  discussion](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/overlap-policy-for-package-onboarding/368)).

Once all items have been checked, Handling Editors may assign reviewers using
the command `@ropensci-review-bot assign stats reviewer <name>`, and generally
following the procedure given in the [*Dev
Guide*](https://devguide.ropensci.org/editorguide.html#look-for-and-assign-reviewers).
Assigning a reviewer will prompt the bot to deliver an additional report of
package structure and function for use by reviewers, as described in the
following chapter.
